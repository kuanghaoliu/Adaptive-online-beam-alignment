1. The folder includes the source codes of continuous-time beam tracking based on neural ordinary differential equation (ODE).
2. The folder includes the source codes of Continuous-Time mmWave Beam Prediction With ODE-LSTM Learning Architecture.
3. The folder is free for academic use, including dataset utilization, simulation result reproduction, model improvement, etc.
4. For academic use, the related work may be published in:
Kuang-Hao (Stanley) Liu, Huang-Chou Lin, ``Low Overhead Beam Alignment for Mobile Millimeter Channel Based on Continuous-Time Prediction'', minor revision, IEEE WCL.
5. The data folder contains millimeter wave channel generation, but you need to download "DeepMIMO_functions" and "Raytracing_scenarios" from the DeepMIMO website : https://www.deepmimo.net/
